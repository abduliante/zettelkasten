# Random business thoughts of mine, subject to debate

## Understanding Saudi Market
The key to understand the Saudi market is to understand the customer behavior of the society. My takes list as follow: 
1. Subscription based apps are not mature enough. People yet not value time unless for entertainment.
2. Trust is ambiguous, building it requires time.
3. Business idea will boom if problem is relatable 
4. Increase market size, dont get a piece of the pie. (Educate the public about your product/service i.e awareness)
