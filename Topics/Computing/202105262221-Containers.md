2. Kurbernetes is the new operating system
3. Containers are the new programs 

# Containers

Container: 
Containers are basically an image that combines different applications and dependancies. 

Image: A dormant program that is not running. Doing `$ docker run` takes that "dormant" program and runs it in the memory. The main difference here is when we use `--rm` and exit, it deletes the process from the memory. 

Now, doing `$ docker run` on a *container* it creates an instance of the image. Anything you do inside of it is saved. Even if the container is paused (stopped), everythis is been written to disk and its not using CPU anymore. (Think about it like putting your program to sleep)



## Why?
Containers differ from virtual machines in a way that VMs virtualize hardware to run multiple OS instances whereas containers virtualize single OS instance to run multiple workloads.
* Small sized, lightweight
* Standalone
* Solves the "it works on my machine!" problem. 
* The best tool for experimentation. 


## Types of containers
LXC containers, docker, etc..
