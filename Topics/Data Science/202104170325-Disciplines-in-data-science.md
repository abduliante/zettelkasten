# Disciplines in Data Science

<br>

## Difference between Analysis and Analytics
- <ins>Analysis</ins>: deals with the past, answers how and why
	- two areas:
		- Qualitative analysis: Explains how? and why?
		- Quantitative analysis: data; for example, how sales decreased last summer 
- <ins>Analytics:</ins> explores potential future events
	- two areas:
		- Qualitative analytics: based on intution and judgement; for example: owning a clothing store, predict the style of clothing for customers
		- Quantitative analytics: applying formulas + algorithms; for instance, introduce the new collection in June based on past historical data. 

## Business Analytics, Data Analytics and Data Science
Some business activities are data-driven while others are <ins>subjective or experience-driven</ins>

<ins>Data Science</ins>: a discipline reliant on data availability; mostly the part that uses complex mathematical, statistical and programming tools

Past (Analysis) | Future (Analytics) | Area
--- | --- | ---
Business Case Studies | -  | Business
- | Qualitative Analytics | Business
Prelimnary Data Report | - | Data
Reporting with Visuals | - | Data
Creating Dashboards | - | Data
- | Sales Forecasting  | Data
-  | 

Data science can be used to improve the accuracy of predictions based on data extracted from various activites typical for specific domain; for example, optimization of drilling operations in oil and gas industry.

## Business Intelligence, Machine Learning and Artifical Intelligence
<ins>Business Intelligence:</ins> the process of analysing and reporting historical business data. Aims to explain past events using business data.

Business intelligence is the preliminary step of predictive analytics

<ins>Machine Learning</ins>: The ability of machines to predict outcomes without being explicitly programmed

ML is about creating and implementing algorithms that let machines receive data and use this data to:
* make predictions
* analyse patterns
* give recommendations

<ins>Artifical Intelligence</ins>: simulating human knowledge and decision making with computers
