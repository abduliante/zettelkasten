# Probability

1 --> Absolute certantiy of event occuring
0 --> Absolute certainty of event not occuring
Higher probabilty value translate more likelihood of occuring

Probabilty quantifies how likely each event is on its own 

## Definition

A --> Event
P (A) --> Probability
P(A) = Prefered outcomes(favorable) / total number of possible outcomes(sample space)

Example:

Coin flip
A ==> Heads 
P(A) = 1/2 

* Independent:
	P(A and B) = P(A) . P(B)
	Example: P(Ace of Spades) = P(Ace) . P(Spades)
	
# Expected Value
The average outcome if we run the experiment many times

trial --> do an event and record an outcome; *example, flip a coin and record outcome*
experiment --> multiple trials

experimental probability is easy to compute; on the other hand, theoritical probabilty is not because it envolves many factors.

same formula: P(A) = successful trials / all trials

E (A) ==> The outcome we expect to occur when we run an experiment
